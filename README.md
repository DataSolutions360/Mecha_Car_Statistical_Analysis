# Mecha_Car_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project

In This challenge, we are slated to discover and analyze the following:

  - Perform multiple linear regression analyses to identify which variable in the dataset predicts the MPG(Miles Per Gallon) of the MechaCar prototypes
  - Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch(PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  - Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.  For each statistical analysis, write a summary of the findings.


## Deliverable 1:  Linear Regression to predict MPG

Using the MechaCar Dataset(CSV), I designed a linear model that predicts the MPG of MechaCar prototypes, using serval variables listed below:

  - Vehicle Length
  - Vehicle Weight
  - AWD
  - MPG(Miles Per Gallon)
  - Spoiler Angle
  - Ground Clearance
